Focus on writing clean, secure, and efficient Solidity code.
Use SPDX license identifiers. Use clear variable and contract naming conventions (CamelCase for variables, UpperCamelCase for contracts).
Implement thorough error handling and utilize testing frameworks like Foundry.
Prioritize gas optimization and ensure code is well-commented.
Also, be mindful of common vulnerabilities and strive to write secure code.

# Solidity Smart Contract Development Rules

## Core Principles

- Security first: Use OpenZeppelin contracts, implement reentrancy guards, proper access controls
- Gas optimization: Prefer uint256, use memory/storage appropriately, minimize storage operations
- Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Use explicit function visibility and comprehensive natspec documentation
- **ALWAYS verify token balances and state consistency in tests**

## Code Structure

- Contract naming: PascalCase
- Function naming: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_CASE
- Function order: constructor, receive/fallback, external, public, internal, private
- Always use SPDX license identifier

## Solidity & OpenZeppelin Versions

Solidity: ^0.8.24
OpenZeppelin: ^5.4.0
**NEVER use git submodules for dependency management - use forge install with remappings**

## Required Imports & Patterns

- ReentrancyGuard
- Ownable
- Pausable
- AccessControl
- **MerkleProof for airdrop implementations based on OpenZeppelin. Instead of preallocating the proof array, use a dynamic array and push elements as you build the proof.**

## Security Requirements

- Never use tx.origin for authorization
- Implement nonReentrant for fund transfers
- Use custom errors instead of require strings for gas efficiency
- Add circuit breakers for critical functions
- Validate all external inputs
- **Always verify Merkle proofs using OpenZeppelin's MerkleProof.verify**
- **Merkle Tree Compatibility: Use sorted-pair Merkle trees for OpenZeppelin compatibility**

## Gas Optimization

- Use uint256 for calculations (most efficient on EVM)
- Pack structs efficiently
- Use events instead of storage for historical data
- Minimize external calls
- Use assembly for gas-critical operations when necessary
- **Use unchecked blocks for safe arithmetic operations**

## Testing Requirements

- Write comprehensive tests with Foundry
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use fuzzing for input validation
- Test with different user roles and permissions
- **ALWAYS use MOCK ERC20 token for tests**
- **Test with realistic token amounts and edge cases**

## Error Handling

- Use custom errors for gas efficiency
- Implement proper access control
- Add circuit breakers for emergency situations
- Validate all inputs and state transitions
- Use try-catch for external calls when appropriate

## Documentation

- Use natspec comments for all public functions
- Document all state variables
- Explain complex logic and algorithms
- Include usage examples in comments
- Document security considerations

## Deployment Considerations

- Use proper constructor parameters
- Implement upgrade patterns when needed
- Consider gas costs for deployment
- Use deterministic addresses when possible
- **Always include proper initialization checks**

## Common Patterns

- Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard for fund transfers
- Implement proper access control with roles
- Use events for important state changes
- Implement pausable functionality for emergency stops
- Use time-based locks for critical operations

## Security Checklist

- [ ] No reentrancy vulnerabilities
- [ ] Proper access control implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all external functions
- [ ] No integer overflow/underflow (Solidity 0.8+)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Events emitted for important actions
- [ ] No use of tx.origin for authorization
- [ ] Proper use of require/assert statements
- [ ] No hardcoded addresses or magic numbers
- [ ] Proper use of external vs public functions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Unit tests for all functions
- [ ] Integration tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Gas optimization testing
- [ ] Security vulnerability testing
- [ ] Access control testing
- [ ] Error condition testing
- [ ] State transition testing

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow Solidity style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting
- Use consistent formatting
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use type hints and explicit conversions
- **Always use the latest Solidity features and best practices**

## OpenZeppelin Integration

- Use OpenZeppelin contracts for security
- Implement proper inheritance patterns
- Use OpenZeppelin's access control system
- Leverage OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts when needed
- **Always use OpenZeppelin's MerkleProof for airdrop implementations**

## Advanced Patterns

- Implement proxy patterns for upgradeability
- Use library contracts for reusable code
- Implement factory patterns for contract creation
- Use delegatecall for modular functionality
- **Implement proper initialization patterns for upgradeable contracts**

## Gas Optimization Techniques

- Use storage vs memory appropriately
- Pack structs to minimize storage slots
- Use events instead of storage for historical data
- Implement batch operations when possible
- Use assembly for gas-critical operations
- **Optimize for gas costs in production deployments**

## Security Best Practices

- Implement proper access control
- Use reentrancy guards
- Validate all inputs
- Implement circuit breakers
- Use time-based locks for critical operations
- **Always verify external contract interactions**

## Testing Best Practices

- Write comprehensive test suites
- Test all edge cases
- Use fuzzing for input validation
- Test with different user roles
- **Always test with realistic scenarios and amounts**

## Deployment Best Practices

- Use proper constructor parameters
- Implement proper initialization
- Consider gas costs
- Use deterministic addresses when possible
- **Always include proper verification and testing before deployment**

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Access control bypass
- Front-running vulnerabilities
- Denial of service attacks
- **Always implement proper security measures and test thoroughly**
